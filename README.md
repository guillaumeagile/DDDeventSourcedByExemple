# eventSourcedByExemple
a repo to work on a DDD project, event sourced architecture and spikes

the idea is to expose, discuss and code about good and bad practices in strategic and tactic DDD:

## Topics that may appears:
- how to explorer and dissect our Bounded Contexts (
- the right size of aggregates
- using immutability
- using VO
- using event sourcing (and yet keep it simple)
- genuine hexagonal architecture
- not to be database oriented
- prove that nothing is CRUD actually



Peut etre on va le faire in French, it depends of the collaborators.
The Ubiquitous Language will be french, the technical parts will be ein english


## technical stack
Some ideas 'en vrac'

what we could use:
- https://martendb.io/introduction.html
- mass transit
- asynchronicity
- https://github.com/louthy/language-ext  (more functional style, monads everythere)
- docker of course (no need to mention)
- no ORM, only SQL builders 
- DAPPER
- Actor Model
